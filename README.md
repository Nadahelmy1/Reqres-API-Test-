Overview:

The reqres.in API is a simple API for testing purposes, providing endpoints for creating users, retrieving user lists, and updating/deleting specific users. I conducted a series of tests on this API using Postman to assess its functionality and gain practical experience with API testing.

Key Tests Performed:

GET /users: Tested fetching a list of users. I verified the response format, including user IDs, email addresses, first and last names.
POST /users: Tested creating a new user. I provided valid user data and checked for a successful response with the newly created user's details.
GET /users/{id}: Tested retrieving a specific user by ID. I provided valid user IDs and verified that the correct user information was returned.
PUT /users/{id}: Tested updating a user's information. I provided a valid user ID and updated user data, then checked for a successful response indicating the updated user.
DELETE /users/{id}: Tested deleting a user. I provided a valid user ID and verified that the response indicated successful deletion.
Learning Outcomes:

API Testing Fundamentals: I reinforced my understanding of basic API testing concepts like HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), request and response structures, status codes, and error handling.
Postman Usage: I gained proficiency in using Postman for API testing, including creating requests, managing collections and environments, and writing test scripts.
API Contract Validation: I learned how to validate API responses against expected schemas or contracts to ensure data integrity.
Error Handling: I practiced identifying and handling common API errors, such as invalid requests, resource not found, and unauthorized access.
API Documentation: I emphasized the importance of clear and concise API documentation for effective testing and understanding.
Overall Assessment:

The reqres.in API provided a valuable platform for honing my API testing skills. By conducting these tests, I gained practical experience in interacting with RESTful APIs, validating responses, and identifying potential issues. This knowledge will be invaluable in future API testing projects.
